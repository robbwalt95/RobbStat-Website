    <h2>Holden Out</h2>
    
    <pre> 



I waited
	Time drifted just as a balloon floats with an endless flow
Seconds flew by
	Cars passed with caution
	Noise traveled bouncing from one place to the next
		With no interference to halt.
			Theres no show..,	So
I waited
	Seconds hit minutes
Minutes ventured
	People passed with ease of non-acknowledgement of their environment
	Feet shuffled crossing black roads
		Covering little distance
			Still here waiting for your show..,		So
I waited
	Noticing double digits click the clock
  An hour has progressed
	The lot became deserted of people
		Scenery changed with exposure of the cracked black gravel
		With the awaking sun; turning black to gray
			I was alone..,		Loosing determination
			Still hanging to your description..,	So
I waited
	I've been here waiting..,			waiting for you
Creating without knowing it
			A voice without sound
					A action with no reason
			I knew it was time to leave..,		time to forget
