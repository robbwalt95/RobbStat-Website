    <h2>About the Chopsticks Program</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/robbwalt95/Chopsticks" target="_blank">Click for GitHub Repo</a></h3>

    <h3><br>Chopsticks Background</h3>
    <p>Chopsticks is a hand game played by usually two people.</p>
    <p>Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_(hand_game)">here</a> to check out the wiki page for rules and general info.</p>


    <h3><br>Rules Modification</h3>
    <p>The version used in this program is a Swaps variation. </p>
    <p>The Swaps variation adds onto the split functionality. </p>
    <p>Once per turn the player can swap any fingers from one hand to the next. </p>
    <p>This allows the swapping of identical fingers (1,1) and no fingers (0,1 -> 1,0). </p>

    <h3><br>Development Technologies</h3>
    <p>Language: Java</p>
    <p>IDE: IntelliJ</p>



    <h3><br>Program History and Motivation</h3>
    <p>First attempted to program this game in 2019 using Python 3. I got a decent chunk developed but for some reason I let it collect dust. </p>
    <p>I originally called the game: Palm Warz, but that was before I found the origins on the Wiki. </p>

    <p><br>Couple years later I found the Palm Warz project. </p>
    <p>I decided to do a little research and revive the project using Java. </p>
    <p>I would like to say the Chopsticks program is now complete from just a few days of development. </p>

    <h3><br>Program Functionality</h3>
    <p>-Player versus Player Mode</p>
    <p>-Player versus Bot Mode with 3 Difficulty Settings</p>
    <p>-Excessive Input Error Handling</p>

    <h3><br>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>I had a lot of fun developing this project. Java was my focus language to try and get more of an Object-Oriented approach.
      I don't think I hit that area well, but it allowed me to scratch the surface more. </p>
    <p> I found it interesting in creating a bot and determining how to make it smarter. What is implemented isn't the smartest but that could change with a few lines. </p>

    <p>This little program I developed is the minimum of what I want to create for this game. In years to come I hope to eventually revive this program once again and develop it cleaner, smarter, and with a GUI interface. </p>
