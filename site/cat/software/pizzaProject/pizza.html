    <h3><br>Project Details</h3>
    <p>College course: CS492 Computer Science Team Project Part 2</p>
    <p>In a group size of four, we were assigned to automate a Book Store using the Scrum framework. </p>
    <p>Project Requirements:</p>
    <p>-Keeping track of inventory</p>
    <p>-Keeping track of sales records</p>
    <p>-Providing the abilities to place orders to manufacturers</p>
    <p>-Providing the ability for customers to place orders</p>

    <h3><br>Technologies</h3>
    <p>Communication Method: Discord</p>
    <p>IDE & Coding Sessions: IntelliJ</p>
    <p>Product Backlog: Google Sheets</p>
    <p>Product Doc: Google Docs</p>
    <p>Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript</p>
    <p>Backend: Java, Spring Framework, H2 Database</p>


    <h3><br>Personal Implementation and Experience</h3>
    <p>The results of this project were accomplished though team effort. </p>
    <p>This project was two Sprints. With a total of two weeks per Sprint.  </p>
    <p>Since I was not with this team for part one, I had a bit to catch up on. Unfortunately, the team members did not coordinate much for the first half. Luckily, this gave me the opportunity to gather, edit, and ultimately connect tasks/stories with each member for the Backlog. For development, we decided to split into two groups. One to focus on the frontend and the other the backend. I was selected for the backend. The roles of developer, Product Owner, and Scrum Master were rotated between each member. </p>
    <p> The primary tasks I accomplished as a Backend Dev include: </p>
    <p>-Initializing Spring Boot and the H2 (In memory) database</p>
    <p>-Feeding data into the database </p>
    <p>-Implementing the ability to query data as an administrator</p>
    <p>-Connecting Spring and Web UI with Hibernate</p>
    <p><br>The primary tasks I accomplished as Product Owner include: </p>
    <p>-Adjusted tasks per Sprint to accommodate deadlines/Stake Holder expectations</p>
    <p>-Used the Project Requirements as reinforcement for project direction</p>

    <p><br>The primary tasks I accomplished as Scrum Master include: </p>
    <p>-Hosted one on one, outside group meetings, and Retros to understand member impediments </p>
    <p>-Insisted on Coding Sessions where critical feedback was professionally handled on all sides</p>
